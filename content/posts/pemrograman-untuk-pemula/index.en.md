# How to learn basic programming language for beginners

Want to learn programming or coding languages ​​for free?

Often seen on social media who have asked how to become a programmer for all platforms and are self-taught.
The thing that must be done to learn to program is to master a programming language. Of course, it is very confusing when you start learning basic coding.
For someone who has studied programming, such as web programming, learning other programming languages ​​is certainly very easy.
Then, how do you learn basic programming for beginners?
Take it easy, don't worry. This time I will share ways to learn programming languages.
Of course when learning to code, namely doing practice, therefore the first intention that must be had is to be ready to practice learning.

## How to learn basic programming language for beginners

The method I write here is a personal experience of writing when I was learning programming, starting from learning programming online by following a tutorial aimed at beginners.

### Understand what a programming language is

The first thing we need to understand is to understand what a programming language is. Understand how programs work and understand the benefits of programming languages.
Many programming languages ​​exist today, such as PHP, Golang, Python, and many more.
To understand what programming language is by reading websites that discuss programming, joining social media such as Facebook.

### Choosing the right method for Learning

Everyone has different ways to start learning whatever it is. Determine the most preferred learning method.

Learning methods that need to be tried are:
- Videos
- Module
- Website
- Documentation

Please select one and then the method above is combined into one, learning to program online. The implementation can try one of the methods above, do it and feel it. If you feel comfortable, continue, but if it is uncomfortable and not digestible, please change to another method.

For myself, when I started the programming language using the Website method, I got the website programming tutorial from farmers, codepolitan, and dicoding.

### Learn programming algorithms

The first time I studied programming was training to learn logic using algorithms. Algorithms are a set of command lines that are carried out sequentially to produce a decision.
To learn programming algorithms, you can use low-level languages ​​such as C language. C and Pascal are suitable for training our brains on how to do problem-solving.
For example, we take an example of a simple program, namely "how to find the average value". To find the average value, you can use a formula. So we implement this formula in the programming language.

### Learn with more skilled people

Learning from people who are more skilled in web programming and another programming will make us understand better. The facts that exist when studying or asking something to others will be clearer and faster.
The person who is more skilled is meant to be a programmer. There are many reliable programmers in Indonesia that you can find in the community or in an IT company.

### Record or document learning outcomes

Note every time you learn something new so that one day you forget it can reopen. One example of learning outcome notes can be a personal blog or stored in a computer application.
Make notes on learning outcomes that are easy to understand and work on neatly. The point is that one day it can be read again and can be understood.

### Make a study schedule

Schedule lessons are very important so that consistent learning can continue. The thing to know is that starting is easier than being consistent with learning.
Therefore, make your own schedule. For assistance in one day, you must learn programming for at least 4 hours. Choose the most suitable and comfortable time. Make learning programming an obligation, that way consistency in learning website programming will be successful.

#### Conclusion
Learning programming languages for beginners can be done easily if the learning method is in accordance with one's personality. Consistency is the most important thing so that learning coding is done quickly and produces work ...

Apart from that in order to learn a computer programming language one has to try an ever-increasing number of case studies ...
