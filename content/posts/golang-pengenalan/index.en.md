# Learn Golang # 1: Get to know Golang Language

** Getting to know Golang, Understanding Go Lang ** - Hello everyone, welcome to my website to learn Indonesian Golang. From now on I will try to consistently discuss the ** Golang programming learning series from the basics **, making ** microservice ** to ** creating golang ** projects.

## Getting acquainted with Golang Language

Have you ever heard of **Golang** programming language?

A language that is popular nowadays, many companies now use the Golang programming language, such as Tokopedia and Gojek.

How good is Golang that large companies use Golang?

### Understanding Golang

Golang or what is often called GO is a free programming language, where this programming language is an open-source programming language.

Golang was developed by Robert, Rob, and Ken on Google in 2007.

A well-known programming language and widely used by developers in 2009.

With the prowess of the Golang programming language, the impact of increased usage is increasing every year, where it only takes approximately 7 years to become a top-level programming language.

The syntax of the Golang programming language is almost like the C (si) programming language. Golang programming declarations are like using variables in the Pascal programming language. So when you master C and Pascal it doesn't take long to learn Golang.

Until now, many large companies are looking for developers who know this programming language, because it has many powerful features to use.

Golang uses a static type (static type) programming where all of the variables of the data type are declared. Golang is a compiled programming language so that when there is an error it will be immediately visible.

### Features and advantages of the Golang programming language

**1. Running fast**

Golang programming language is relatively fast when accessed by users, the speed of the GO programming language cannot be doubted.

Why is it faster?

Go is a compiler and is not an interpreter, every variable declaration must involve a process and cannot create variables but are not used.

On the developer's side, this speed makes a developer very fast in testing the system.

**2. Easy to learn**

The syntax in the GO programming is fairly simple so it's easy to learn. Besides that, the GO programming structure is also very neat so it doesn't confuse the developers to understand the existing structure.

[Go](https://hackernoon.com/the-beauty-of-go-98057e3f0a7d) itself has provided Tour facilities for the benefit of interactive Go learning.

**3. Discipline**

Every time you create a process, as I mentioned earlier, you have to declare a variable and data type when using it, the data type used must be in the case.

**4. Lots of community**

With the existence of many communities, it means that there is also more development or modification or creation of a Go language library.

So, you don't need to worry when there are problems when learning GO programming, you can use the community to ask questions about the GO programming language.

**5. Concurrency**

Concurrency is a mini thread, where we can run many methods/functions at the same time. So there is no need to wait a long time when running more than one process.
