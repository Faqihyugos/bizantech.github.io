## Hi there

My name is Faqih Yugo Susilo, a software engineer, designer, photographer and linux enthusiast.

A blog for documentation on programming, design, and course materials. I also like studying technology, but I often forget, that's the reason why I write. Hopefully the presence of this blog can help friends and students learn about technology.

get in touch:
